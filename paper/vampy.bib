abstract = {An efficient finite difference model of blood flowthrough the coronary vessels is de- veloped and applied to a geometric model of the largest six generations of the coronary arterial net- work. By constraining the form of the velocity profile across the vessel radius, the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations are reduced to one-dimensional equations governing conservation of mass and momentum. These equations are coupled to a pressure-radius relationship characterizing the elasticity of the vessel wall to describe the transient blood flow through a vessel segment. The two step Lax–Wendroff finite difference method is used to numerically solve these equations. The flow through bifurcations, where three vessel segments join, is governed by the equations of conserva- tion of mass and momentum. The solution to these simultaneous equations is calculated using the multidimensional Newton–Raphson method. Simulations of blood flow through a geometric model of the coronary network are presented demonstrating physiologically realistic flow rates, washout curves, and pressure distributions.},

@article{Azer2007,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a one-dimensional model for blood flow in arteries, without assuming an a priori shape for the velocity profile across an artery (Azer, Ph.D. thesis, Courant Institute, New York University, 2006). We combine the one-dimensional equations for conservation of mass and momentum with the Womersley model for the velocity profile in an iterative way. The pressure gradient of the one-dimensional model drives the Womersley equations, and the velocity profiles calculated then feed back into both the friction and nonlinear parts of the one-dimensional model. Besides enabling us to evaluate the friction correctly and also to use the velocity profile to correct the nonlinear terms, having the velocity profile available as output should be useful in a variety of applications. We present flow simulations using both structured trees and pure resistance models for the small arteries, and compare the resulting flow and pressure waves under various friction models. Moreover, we show how to couple the one-dimensional equations with the Taylor diffusion limit (Azer, Int J Heat Mass Transfer 2005;48:2735-40; Taylor, Proc R Soc Lond Ser A 1953;219:186-203) of the convection-diffusion equations to drive the concentration of a solute along an artery in time.},

@article{Olufsen2000,
abstract = {Blood flow in the large systemic arteries is modeled using one-dimensional equations derived from the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations for flow in compliant and tapering vessels. The arterial tree is truncated after the first few generations of large arteries with the remaining small arteries and arterioles providing outflow boundary conditions for the large arteries. By modeling the small arteries and arterioles as a structured tree, a semi-analytical approach based on a linearized version of the governing equations can be used to derive an expression for the root impedance of the structured tree in the frequency domain. In the time domain, this provides the proper outflow boundary condition. The structured tree is a binary asymmetric tree in which the radii of the daughter vessels are scaled linearly with the radius of the parent vessel. Blood flow and pressure in the large vessels are computed as functions of time and axial distance within each of the arteries. Comparison between the simulations and magnetic resonance measurements in the ascending aorta and nine peripheral locations in one individual shows excellent agreement between the two. {\textcopyright} 2000 Biomedical Engineering Society.

@article{Alastruey2007,
abstract = {Blood flow in the circle of Willis (CoW) is modelled using the 1-D equations of pressure and flow wave propagation in compliant vessels. The model starts at the left ventricle and includes the largest arteries that supply the CoW. Based on published physiological data, it is able to capture the main features of pulse wave propagation along the aorta, at the brachiocephalic bifurcation and throughout the cerebral arteries. The collateral ability of the complete CoW and its most frequent anatomical variations is studied in normal conditions and after occlusion of a carotid or vertebral artery (VA). Our results suggest that the system does not require collateral pathways through the communicating arteries to adequately perfuse the brain of normal subjects. The communicating arteries become important in cases of missing or occluded vessels, the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) being a more critical collateral pathway than the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs) if an internal carotid artery (ICA) is occluded. Occlusions of the VAs proved to be far less critical than occlusions of the ICAs. The worst scenario in terms of reduction in the mean cerebral outflows is a CoW without the first segment of an anterior cerebral artery combined with an occlusion of the contralateral ICA. Furthermore, in patients without any severe occlusion of a carotid or VA, the direction of flow measured at the communicating arteries corresponds to the side of the CoW with an absent or occluded artery. Finally, we study the effect of partial occlusions of the communicating arteries on the cerebral flows, which again confirms that the ACoA is a more important collateral pathway than the PCoAs if an ICA is occluded.},

The parallel-coupled model is thoroughly discussed, with scalability proven up to hundreds of cores. This work focuses on the mechanical part, including the constitutive model (proposing some modifications to pre-existent models), the numerical scheme and the coupling strategy. The model is next assessed through two examples. First, the simulation of a small piece of cardiac tissue is used to introduce the main features of the coupled model and calibrate its parameters against experimental evidence. Then, a more realistic prob- lem is solved using those parameters, with a mesh of the Oxford ventricular rabbit model. The results of both examples demonstrate the capability of the model to run efficiently in hundreds of processors and to reproduce some basic characteristic of cardiac deformation.},

The three implementation types have been applied for resistance and Windkessel outflow boundary conditions. The results show that the implicit Lax-Wendroff method leads to the greatest execution times and can not be used for medium and small vessels due to its divergent behavior. The explicit Lax-Wendroff method offers the best compromise between accuracy and execution speed. The implicit method of characteristics should only be used when the explicit Lax-Wendroff method diverges.},
